[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/cnvo/nodebb-majestic.svg)](https://travis-ci.org/cnvo/nodebb-majestic)

Majestic is a [NodeBB](https://github.com/NodeBB/NodeBB) theme based on HTML5 Broilerplate, gulp, Bowser, and Bootstrap that will help you make better themes. It's a beautiful, responsive theme developed to be an awesome experience no matter what device it's viewed on. We picked color schemes and an appropriate font family comfortable to the eye with a mobile first approach down to the last pixel.

## Requirements
Majestic requires the following software to be installed:

`nodebb >= 0.8.x`

## Installation

NodeBB expects any installed themes to be installed via `npm`. 
You can install Majestic through the command line by using the following command:
`npm install nodebb-theme-majestic`

Majestic also uses [gulp](http://gulpjs.com/) as its build system and [Bower](http://bower.io/) to manage front-end packages.

Building the theme requires [node.js](http://nodejs.org/download/). It is recommended that you update to the latest version of npm: `npm install -g npm@latest`.

via the command line:

1. Install [gulp](http://gulpjs.com) and [Bower](http://bower.io/) globally with `npm install -g gulp bower`
2. Navigate to the theme directory, then run `npm install`
3. Run `bower install`

You now have all the necessary dependencies to run the build process.
